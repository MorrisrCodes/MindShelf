# MindShelf

Welcome to **MindShelf**, an AI-powered book summarizer designed to help you pick up right where you left off in any book! Powered by **OpenAI**, MindShelf provides in-depth summaries based on a specific page number so you can quickly dive back into the book without needing to reread earlier chapters.

## Project Overview

This project was initially built by a team of four, including myself. In this personal continuation of the project, I will be focused on adding a few additional features. An about to explain how to use the site, why we made it, a demo and promo video, update styling, rehost, and more.

My personal contribution in the inital creation of the project was integrating OpenAI into the system and creating the prompts for accurate and meaningful book summaries.

### How It Works

- Input the title of a book and the page number you've last read.
- The AI will generate a summary of the book up to that point, allowing you to jump right back into reading without hesitation.

**MindShelf** is the perfect tool for readers who want to quickly refresh their memory on books theyâ€™ve temporarily set aside.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Summaries:** Receive a detailed summary of a book up to any specific page.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface:** Designed to make book summarization fast and accessible.
